# Available Themes in QuantumCSS

QuantumCSS provides a flexible theming system that allows developers to easily switch between different visual styles. Currently, two primary themes are included: **Light** and **Dark**. Each theme is designed to provide a distinct look and feel while maintaining consistency across components.

## Light Theme

The **Light Theme** is designed for bright environments and offers a clean, minimalistic aesthetic. It features light backgrounds with darker text for optimal readability.

### Key Features:
- Light background colors
- Dark text colors for contrast
- Suitable for daytime use

### Usage:
To apply the light theme, include the following CSS file in your project:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/quantumcss/dist/themes/light.css">
```

## Dark Theme

The **Dark Theme** is tailored for low-light environments, providing a darker background with lighter text. This theme is ideal for reducing eye strain in dimly lit settings.

### Key Features:
- Dark background colors
- Light text colors for contrast
- Suitable for nighttime use

### Usage:
To apply the dark theme, include the following CSS file in your project:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/quantumcss/dist/themes/dark.css">
```

## Custom Themes

In addition to the built-in themes, QuantumCSS allows developers to create custom themes by modifying the CSS variables defined in the theme files. This flexibility enables you to tailor the appearance of your application to match your brand or design preferences.

### Creating a Custom Theme:
1. Copy one of the existing theme files (light.css or dark.css).
2. Modify the CSS variables to suit your design.
3. Link your custom theme in your HTML.

## Conclusion

QuantumCSS's theming capabilities make it easy to adapt the framework to various design requirements. Whether you prefer a light or dark aesthetic, or wish to create a custom theme, QuantumCSS provides the tools you need to achieve your desired look.
